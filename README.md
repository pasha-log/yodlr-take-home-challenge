## Description: 

This was a mock take home challenge where I was provided a backend directory that was made with Express and a JSON store database. 

The challenge was to create a simple registration page and an admin page that showed all users. For more details, read the [backend read me](https://github.com/pasha-log/yodlr-take-home-challenge/blob/main/yodlr-backend/README.md).
